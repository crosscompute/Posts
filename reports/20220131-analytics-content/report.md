In 2022-01, we published 1 report, 2 automations and 8 examples using [crosscompute 0.9.0](https://pypi.org/project/crosscompute).

# Reports

- [Locating Hospitals in Mayfield, Kentucky, USA](https://forum.crosscompute.com/t/hazard-mitigation/167) presents the [Find Places](https://crosscompute.net/a/find-places) tool for gathering critical building location data, based on the task of locating medical infrastructure in Mayfield, Kentucky. The town was recently hit by a tornado that caused widespread power outages. Locating buildings is the first step in planning a microgrid that can keep critical buildings operational during an emergency.

# Automations

{ find-places-screenshot }

- [Find Places](https://crosscompute.net/a/find-places) is a tool for preparing a critical building dataset for hazard mitigation planning. Enter a description of the building type and a location and the tool will prepare a CSV using the Google Places API.

- [Send Emails](https://crosscompute.net/a/send-emails) is a tool for automating emails where each recipient receives a different message with attachments, based on a template.

# Examples

- [Gather Locations](https://crosscompute.net/a/gather-locations) is an example of a form for gathering location data. The [example configuration](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/forms/gather-locations/gather.yml) demonstrates how to specify input variables for your form. The [example script](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/forms/gather-locations/gather.py) saves geocoded locations to a file and uses `flock` to ensure that only one process is accessing the file at any time.
- [Manage Locations](https://crosscompute.net/a/manage-locations) is an example of a widget for mapping location data gathered from the [Gather Locations](https://crosscompute.net/a/gather-locations) form. The [example configuration](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/forms/gather-locations/manage.yml) demonstrates how to map the collected locations using `view: map-deck-screengrid`. The [example script](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/forms/gather-locations/manage.py) saves coordinates for each location and computes the map viewport.
- [Randomize Histograms](https://crosscompute.net/a/randomize-histograms) is an example of a report with static images. The [example configuration](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/reports/randomize-histograms/automate.yml) demonstrates how to use `view: image` to render static images generated by the Jupyter notebook. The [example notebook](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/reports/randomize-histograms/run.ipynb) demonstrates how to save output images to the output folder.
- [Show Maps](https://crosscompute.net/a/show-maps) is an example of a report that shows a GeoJSON polygon on different maps. The [example configuration](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/reports/show-maps/automate.yml) demonstrates how to use `view: map-mapbox` to render the polygon with different map styles and fill colors.
- [Map Schools](https://crosscompute.net/a/map-schools) is an example of a report that maps a dynamic choropleth. The [example configuration](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/reports/map-schools/automate.yml) shows how to use `view: map-deck-screengrid` to render the dynamic choropleth. The [example notebook](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/reports/map-schools/run.ipynb) demonstrates how to prepare the dynamic choropleth coordinate locations from an external spreadsheet.
- [Ask Question](https://crosscompute.net/a/ask-question) is an example of a tool that generates a markdown output variable. The [example configuration](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/tools/ask-question/automate.yml) shows how to use `view: markdown` to render the markdown. The [example notebook](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/tools/ask-question/run.ipynb) demonstrates how to save the markdown file in the output folder.
- [Add Numbers](https://crosscompute.net/a/add-numbers) is an example of a tool that takes two numbers as input variables. The [example configuration](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/tools/add-numbers/automate.yml) shows how to use `view: number` to render the input variables as number fields. The [example script](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/tools/add-numbers/run.py) demonstrates how to load variables from the input folder and save variables to the output folder.
- [Paint Letters](https://crosscompute.net/a/paint-letters) is an example of a widget that takes text as an input variable and generates an SVG image output variable. The [example configuration](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/widgets/paint-letters/automate.yml) shows how to use `view: text` to render the input variable as a text field. The [example notebook](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples/blob/master/widgets/paint-letters/run.ipynb) demonstrates how to transform the text into a static choropleth using an SVG template.
