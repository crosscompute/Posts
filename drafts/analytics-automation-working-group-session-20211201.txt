## Analytics Automation System

Last month, we focused on rewriting our automation framework from scratch. The [crosscompute 0.9 branch](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute/tree/0.9.0) that is in development is not yet compatible with the previous versions of our editing service and publishing platform. However, all of our previous systems are still running and ready to use: [0.8](https://crosscompute.com/authentications), [0.7](https://legacy.crosscompute.com/create).

- Data Warehouse
- Editing Service
- Automation Framework: [code](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute), [docs](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-docs), [examples](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute-examples)
- Publishing Platform
- Analytics Marketplace

Here is what has been done:

- Reload the automations server when files change.
- Serve multiple automations from a single configuration file by configuring `imports`.
- Render images using the `image` view.
- Render interactive maps from geojson using the `map-mapbox` view.

Here is what we will do next:

- Support template syntax for defining batches.
- Finish the `map-pydeck-screengrid` and `markdown` views.
- Prepare packages for PyPI.

Here is how you can help:

- Prototype more examples of reports, forms, tools, widgets, dashboards that you want to automate.
- Suggest more views that you want to render in your automations.

## Hazard Mitigation Planning System

We began early planning work on how to integrate our previous algorithms for microgrid planning into a step-by-step form for benefit cost analysis, but the work is currently paused as we focus on rewriting our Analytics Automation System.
